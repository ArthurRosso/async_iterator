# Rust AsyncIterator

This Rust code defines an asynchronous iterator trait (AsyncIterator) and its associated types and implementations. It provides a framework for transforming and processing asynchronous data streams in a composable and efficient manner.

## AsyncIterator Trait:

The `AsyncIterator` trait defines the core functionality for asynchronous iterators. It specifies two methods:

* `fold_folder`: Applies a fold operation to the iterator's elements using a provided Folder instance.

* `async_fold`: A higher-order version of `fold_folder` that takes an initial value and a fold function as parameters.

## Map, Filter, and Collect Implementations:

The `AsyncIterator` trait provides three methods for transforming and filtering the iterator's elements:

* `map`: Applies a provided function to each element and returns a new iterator containing the transformed elements.

* `filter`: Filters the iterator's elements based on a provided predicate function, returning only those elements that satisfy the predicate.

* `collect_vec`: Collects all the elements of the iterator into a Vec.

## Folder Trait and BasicFolder Struct:

The `Folder` trait defines the fold operation for asynchronous iterators. It takes an initial value and a fold function as input and returns an updated value. The `BasicFolder` struct implements the `Folder` trait and provides a default fold operation.

## MapFolder and FilterFolder Structs:

The `MapFolder` and `FilterFolder` structs specialize the `Folder` trait for `Map` and `Filter` iterators, respectively. They apply the respective transformation or filtering logic to each element before calling the base Folder's fold operation.

## Iter, Map, and Filter Struct Implementations:

The `Iter`, `Map`, and `Filter` structs implement the `AsyncIterator` trait for various types of asynchronous iterators. They handle the specific logic for iterating over and processing their respective data sources.
